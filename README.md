# PulseCounter
This is a part of a project to count an input pulses and display them to an output lcd.
The project is an ergonomic control system in packaging company. It counts trays or products and controls the pallets position up and down to allow the packaging worker to avoid bending down so as to keep an upright position. This portion of code is a pulse counter which uses pulses from a function generator used as input to reprent sensor input to the microcontroller. The sensor should in real life count the trays or boxes passing through it on a conveyor belt.
